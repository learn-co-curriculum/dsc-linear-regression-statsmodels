    "## What is `statsmodels` ?\n",
    "\n",
    "`statsmodels` is a powerful Python package for many types of statistical analysis. Again, if Python was installed via Anaconda, then the module was installed at the same time. In statistics, ordinary least square (OLS) regression is a method for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. It minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances between the observed values and the values predicted by the linear approximation. The OLS method in statsmodels is widely used for regression experiments in all fields of study.\n",

    "Wow , thats a lot of information. statsmodels performs a ton of tests and calculates measures to identify goodness of fit. \n",

    "* We can find our R-squared which in this case is 0.95 i.e. very highly related. \n",
    "* We can also look at the co-efficients of the model for slope and intercept\n",
    "* Kurtosis and Skew values are shown on the terms we described earlier\n",
    "* A lot of significance testing\n",
    "---\n",
    "Here is a brief description of these measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dep. Variable: Singular. Which variable is the point of interest of the model\n",
    "* Model: Technique used, abbreviated version of Method (see methods for more).\n",
    "* Method: The loss function optimized in the parameter selection process. Least Squares since it picks the parameters that reduce the training error. AKA Mean Square Error [MSE].\n",
    "* No. Observations: The number of observations used by the model. Size of training data.\n",
    "* Degrees of Freedom Residuals: Degrees of freedom of the residuals. Number of observations – number of parameters. Intercept is a parameter. The purpose of Degrees of Freedom is to reflect the impact of descriptive/summarizing statistics in the model, which in regression is the coefficient. Since the observations must \"live up\" to these parameters, they only have so many free observations, and the rest must be reserved to \"live up\" to the parameters' prophecy. Internal mechanism to ensures that there are enough observations to parameters.\n",
    "* Degrees of Freedom Model: Number of parameters in the model (not including the constant/intercept term if present)\n",
    "* Covariance Type: Robust regression methods are designed to be not overly affected by violations of assumptions by the underlying data-generating process. Since this model is Ordinary Least Squares, it is non-robust and therefore highly sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The right part of the first table shows the goodness of fit \n",
    "\n",
    "* R-squared: The coefficient of determination, the Sum Squares of Regression divided by Total Sum Squares. In English, translates in the percent of variance explained by the model. The remaining percentage represents the variance explained by error, the E term, that which the model and predictors fail to grasp.\n",
    "* Adj. R-squared: Version of the R-Squared that penalizes additional independent variables. Similar to the concept of flexibility in the Bias-Variance tradeoff where high flexibility reduces bias, but puts the model at risk of high variance; the magnitude of effect a single observation can have on the model outcome. This lowers model robustness and model generalization.\n",
    "* F-statistic: A measure how significant the fit is. The mean squared error of the model divided by the mean squared error of the residuals. Feeds into the calculation of the P-Value.\n",
    "* Prob (F-statistic) or P-Value: The probability that a sample like this would yield the above statistic, and whether the models verdict on the null hypothesis will consistently represent the population. Does not measure effect magnitude, instead measures the integrity and consistency of this test on this group of data.\n",
    "* Log-likelihood: The log of the likelihood function.\n",
    "* AIC: The Akaike Information Criterion. Adjusts the log-likelihood based on the number of observations and the complexity of the model. Penalizes the model selection metrics when more independent variables are added.\n",
    "* BIC: The Bayesian Information Criterion. Similar to the AIC, but has a higher penalty for models with more parameters. Penalizes the model selection metrics when more independent variables are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second Table: Coefficient Reports \n",
    "\n",
    "* coef: The estimated value of the coefficient. By how much the model multiplies the independent value by.\n",
    "* std err: The basic standard error of the estimate of the coefficient. Average distance deviation of the points from the model, which offers a unit relevant way to gauge model accuracy.\n",
    "* t: The t-statistic value. This is a measure of how statistically significant the coefficient is.\n",
    "* P > |t|: P-value that the null-hypothesis that the coefficient = 0 is true. If it is less than the confidence level, often 0.05, it indicates that there is a statistically significant relationship between the term and the response.\n",
    "* [95.0% Conf. Interval]: The lower and upper values of the 95% confidence interval. Specific range of the possible coefficient values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third Table: Residuals, Autocorrelation, and Multicollinearity \n",
    "\n",
    "* Skewness: A measure of the symmetry of the data about the mean. Normally-distributed errors should be symmetrically distributed about the mean (equal amounts above and below the line). The normal distribution has 0 skew.\n",
    "* Kurtosis: A measure of the shape of the distribution. Compares the amount of data close to the mean with those far away from the mean (in the tails), so model \"peakyness\". The normal distribution has a Kurtosis of 3, and the greater the number, the more the curve peaks.\n",
    "* Omnibus D’Angostino’s test: It provides a combined statistical test for the presence of skewness and kurtosis.\n",
    "* Prob(Omnibus): The above statistic turned into a probability\n",
    "* Jarque-Bera: A different test of the skewness and kurtosis\n",
    "* Prob (JB): The above statistic turned into a probability\n",
    "* Durbin-Watson: A test for the presence of autocorrelation (that the errors are not independent.) Often important in time-series analysis\n",
    "* Cond. No: A test for multicollinearity (if in a fit with multiple parameters, the parameters are related with each other).\n",
